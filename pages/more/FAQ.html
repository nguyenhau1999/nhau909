               <p> Not to worry! <span class="text-primary">Our skin</span> is ultra-sensitive to external factors such as temperature changes, aggressive air-conditioning, overheated rooms, air that is too dry or too humid. The slightest change can be enough to dehydrate it. All skin types suffer from a lack of moisture, be it dry, combination or oily.</p>

               2. Dehydrated skin vs. dry skin?

              <p>Dehydrated skin and dry skin are usually used synonymously but they are actually different. Dehydrated skin, in simple terms, signifies that the skin lacks water. It will look dry and dull, but with the right lifestyle changes, your skin can restore its natural radiance. Dry skin, on the other hand, is used to describe skin that produces less sebum than normal. Just like normal, oily and combination skin types, dry skin type is what you are born with. An important thing to note is that our skin types may also change depending on the season and with age.</p>

Tackle dehydrated skin by replenishing moisture levels and giving skin the ingredients it needs to stay protected. Firstly, choose the right moisturising cream for your skin type.
